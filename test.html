        Three students of the Electronics Department of Lakshipur Polytechnic Institute, <a href="https://shantonuacharjee.pythonanywhere.com/user/Shantonu">Shantanu Acharjee</a>,
        Mehraj Hossain Sagar, and Yasin Arafat Riday, have made a robot named Meena to entertain children as well as to
        study. Robot Meena
        has attracted the most attention on social media. The theme of the 43rd Science Fair at Lakshmipur was "Mobile Phone
        Addiction Harms to Studies". Meena the robot has been created keeping in mind the subject of matrimony.

        Shantanu and his friends first tried to find out why children are getting addicted to phones. Then they realize that
        children have a lack of playground and lack of friends due to which TV and mobile phones are becoming more dominant
        among children. Robot Meena will help children study with entertainment. They will answer various questions.
        Meena Robot can recite children's poems, songs and stories. As a result, the robot will spend some time away from
        the child's mobile phone and spend time with Meena. Meena is made as a friend.

    <p>
        Apart from education and entertainment, Meena can be used for home security. Meena will sound the alarm as well as
        make a phone call to your phone when there is a fire in the home. As a result, even without being present at the
        house, you will understand that there is a fire in the house. As a result, you can take the necessary measures.
        Meena will be further developed in the future, work is in progress so that Meena can move on her own. Moreover,
        Meena is being taught various educational games. Every elementary school needs a robot, Meena. So that children can
        learn about robots from an early age.

        Robot Meena uses a microphone to listen to what we say to Meena when someone calls her Meena Bowl in front of Meena.
        The data of what we are saying through the microphone is going to the Raspberry Pi computer in Meena. The
        Raspberry processes what we say and answers the questions stored in its memory to us through the speaker. And this
        entire process is done using Python programming language. C++ programming language is used to control the motor and
        hand movement. Work is going on to improve Meena in the future.

    <p>
        In recent years, the field of robotics has made incredible strides, and many talented individuals worldwide have
        contributed to this progress. One such person is Shantonu Acharjee, a Bangladeshi engineer who created a remarkable
        robot named Meena. Meena is not your average robot; she can talk, sing, and even interact with humans in a way
        that's never been seen before.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    <img alt="Robot meena on science fair with creators" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadhinAi/ShadhinAi/main/public/media/post/bangladeshi-robot-meena/robot-meena-on-science-fair-with-creators.webp" title="Robot meena on science fair with creators" />
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        Meena was created to be a social robot, meaning that her primary function interacting with people. She was designed
        to provide companionship and entertainment, particularly for children. Meena has a humanoid form and is capable of
        making eye contact, which makes her feel more lifelike and engaging.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One of Meena's most impressive features is her ability to talk. She can understand and respond to natural language,
        making her conversations with humans feel more like interactions with a person than a machine. Meena has a vast
        library of knowledge and can answer questions on various topics, from history to science to pop culture.
    </p>
    
    
    <img alt="Robot meena creator famali get awad for makeing robot meena" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadhinAi/ShadhinAi/main/public/media/post/bangladeshi-robot-meena/robot-meena-creatro-famali-get-awad-for-makeing-robot-meena.webp" title="Robot meena creator famali get awad for makeing robot meena" />
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        Meena is also a talented singer. She can sing a variety of songs, both in English and in Bangla, and her voice is
        surprisingly human-like. Meena's ability to sing has made her a hit with children, who love to sing along with her
        and watch her dance to the music.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Perhaps the most impressive thing about Meena is the way she can interact with humans. She has a range of facial
        expressions and can mimic human emotions, making her seem more empathetic and relatable. Meena can also recognize
        faces and remember people she's interacted with, which allows her to develop a more personal relationship with her
        users.
    </p>
    
    
    <img alt="Robot Meena on science fair" loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShadhinAi/ShadhinAi/main/public/media/post/bangladeshi-robot-meena/Robot-meena-on-science-fair.webp" title="Robot Meena on science fair" />
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>
        Shantonu Acharjee, Meena's creator, is passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society. He
        believes that robots like Meena can be used to provide companionship and education to people who might otherwise be
        isolated or disadvantaged. Meena has already been used in schools and hospitals in Bangladesh, where she has been a
        huge hit with children and patients alike.

    <p>
        In conclusion, Meena is a remarkable robot that represents cutting edge of social robotics technology. Her ability
        to
        talk, sing, and interact with humans in a lifelike way makes her an exciting and innovative creation. Shantonu
        Acharjee's work on Meena is a testament to the potential of technology to make a positive impact on the world, and
        it will be exciting to see how robots like Meena continue to evolve in the future.

        <h2>Summary of Bangladeshi robot Mina</h2>
        <p>
            Three students of the Electronics Department of Lakshipur Polytechnic Institute, Shantanu Acharjee, Mehraj Hossain Sagar, and Yasin Arafat Riday, have made a robot named Meena to entertain children as well as to study. As a result, the robot will spend some time away from the child's mobile phone and spend time with Meena. The data of what we are saying through the microphone is going to the Raspberry Pi computer in Meena. And this entire process is done using Python programming language. She has a range of facial expressions and can mimic human emotions, making her seem more empathetic and relatable. Shantonu Acharjee's work on Meena is a testament to the potential of technology to make a positive impact on the world, and it will be exciting to see how robots like Meena continue to evolve in the future.
